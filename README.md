![Portfolio Preview](./preview.png)
*(An immersive web portfolio built entirely with React, Three.js, TailwindCSS, and creativity.)*

## 🌌 Overview

This is my personal **interactive developer portfolio**, designed to showcase my **skills, projects, and experience** — but with a twist.
It’s not just a resume website — it’s an **interactive, animated experience** blending **technology, creativity, and playfulness**.

The project combines smooth animations, 3D visuals, and game-inspired interactions to reflect both the **technical depth** and **creative drive** behind my work.
